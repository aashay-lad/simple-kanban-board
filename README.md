# simple-kanban-board

This is one of the project of a 15 Project Series made by Codesistency on Youtube. I'm currently learning by following along with this YouTube video, which covers a HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I'm taking notes, coding along, adding my own touch to it and documenting what I learn here in this repository. This is a work in progress as I continue watching and practicing each section.

In this project, I learned about the HTML Drag and Drop API and how it works.
